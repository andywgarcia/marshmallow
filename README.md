# Marshmallow

I came out of college with lots of student debt, nearly 3 times the average amount for a college student. Now that I am repaying these loans, I am focusing on killing this debt with as much intensity as I can. However, there are times when me and my family still want to go out to eat. This is always a hard choice because I stop to ask the question "How much is this dinner actually going to cost? If I spend $30 on dinner, how much will it cost me in interest to not put that $30 toward the student loans today?" I am not looking to answer the question "How much money would I save if I put in $30 every month", but instead, is this dinner really worth the $30 + the interest from my student loans. I want to make a wise and informed decision instead of just let my student loans secretly increase the cost of my current lifestyle more than it already has.

This is designed to help make that wise and informed decision.

# Why name is Marshmallow?

The [delayed gratification experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment) done by Stanford always has me thinking "What if I just wanted 1 marshmallow?" The results simply imply that somebody is "less successful" if they don't wait for the second marshmallow. But can I be just as successful if I really knew what I was doing? Maybe. Maybe not. But at least I know when I am making the decision.
